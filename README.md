Worldo Alpha

Discussion thread at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=435803

Please let us know if you would like to contribute code, there is plenty to do.

We'll soon be starting a round of crowdfunding to help move the project along.

Base code is litecoin/smallchange with kimotos gravity well but we'll soon move to Quark, vertcoin or a combination of both.

Worldo will be pure CPU so everyone can use it with any computer.
